### *5G is good for India for the following reasons:*

**1. High speeds**

5G works faster on mobile phones and other devices when compared to 4G and 4G LTE. It allows users to download movies, videos, and music in seconds as opposed to minutes. 

**2. Low latency**

5G has low latency when compared to 4G that will support new applications such as AI, IoT, and virtual reality efficiently. Not only that, it enables mobile phone users to open a webpage and browse things without any hassles.

**3. Increased capacity**

5G has the capacity to deliver up to 100 times more capacity than 4G. It allows companies to switch between cellular and Wi-Fi wireless strategies that will help a lot to experience better performance.

**4. More bandwidth**

One of the main advantages of 5G is that it increases more bandwidth that will help transfer the data as soon as possible. Furthermore, mobile phone users can ensure a faster connection with more bandwidth after choosing a 5G network. 

**5. Powering innovation**

5G technology is the perfect choice for connecting with a whole range of different devices including drones and sensors. It gives ways to power the adoption of IoT allowing industries to enhance their productivity and other things. 

**6. Less tower congestion**

4G cellular networks often get congested which will result in various problems while accessing important data. On the other hand, 5G networks allow users to avoid them due to better speed and more bandwidth.

**7. Virtual medical operation**

This ultimately can help in virtual surgery which can be performed from a remote location. Patients don't have to wait for too long if the doctors is not available.
