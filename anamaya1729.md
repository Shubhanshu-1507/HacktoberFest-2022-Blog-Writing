# Technologies to learn in next 5 years

This blog is a collection of technologies that I think are worth learning in next 5 years. I have tried to categorize them based on their usage and popularity. I have also tried to include technologies that are not very popular but are worth learning. I have also tried to include technologies that are not very popular but are worth learning.
